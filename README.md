Why are we doing this?
Setting up your development environment properly is one of the first and most important steps in building any project. As developers, it's not only about writing code, but also about managing the codebase and working with others efficiently.
By completing this task, youâ€™ll:
Learn how to set up a Node.js project.
Understand how Git helps in version control, making it easier to track and manage your code changes.
Install essential npm packages that simplify common tasks - Express, Nodemon, Dotenv and Mongoose.
Push your code to GitHub, allowing you to showcase your work.
1. Create a New Node.js Project:

Open your terminal or command line.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Initialize Git:

Run the command git init to start a new Git repository in your project folder.
Create a new repository on GitHub and copy the repository URL.
Link your local repository to GitHub(Hint: Use git remote add origin <your-repository-url>.)
3. Initialize the Node.js Project:**

Run the command npm init to create a package.json file for your project. Follow the prompts to set up the project.
4. Install Required Packages

Install the packages Express, Nodemon, Dotenv and Mongoose.
5. Verify Package Installation
